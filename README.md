# RecenterTopBottom

A [Sublime Text 2][ST2] or [Sublime Text 3][ST3] plugin that cycles between moving the current line to the top, middle and bottom of the visible screen area.

## Installation

1. Open the Sublime Text 2 or 3  Packages folder:

    - OS X: `~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
    - Windows: `%APPDATA%/Sublime Text 2/Packages/`
    - Linux: `~/.Sublime Text 2/Packages/`

2. Clone this repo:
<pre>
git clone git://github.com/mburrows/RecenterTopBottom.git
</pre>

## Commands

This plugin provides a single command called `recenter_top_bottom`. Repeated calls to this command will move the current line to the top, middle and bottom of the visible screen area. The ordering can be customised using the settings file.

## Keybindings

The default keybinding is similar to `ctrl+l` which is bound to the built in `show_at_center` command:

    { "keys": ["ctrl+alt+l"], "command": "recenter_top_bottom" }

Personally I override the `show_at_center` command with `recenter_top_bottom`, it provides all the functionality of the original command and more. This can be accomplished by putting the following in your `Key Bindings - User` file:

    { "keys": ["ctrl+l"], "command": "recenter_top_bottom" }

## Settings

To change the ordering create a file called `Packages/User/RecenterTopBottom.sublime-settings` and redefine the `recenter_positions` setting as follows:

    {
        "recenter_positions": ["middle", "top", "bottom"]
    }

## Issues

We know about the issue for users using word_wrap. It will work for you too. It will just not scroll to the top but almost. The amount of lines that is wraped, is same amount that is scroll will be of by
